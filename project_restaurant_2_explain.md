Certainly! Below is a detailed breakdown of the code that you can save in a folder for future reference. It explains each part of the code, including functions, loops, and specific methods like `menu.keys()`.

# **Complete Breakdown of the Restaurant Ordering Code**

## **1. Greeting the User**

### **Purpose:**
- Start the program with a friendly greeting to the user, making the interaction more welcoming.

### **Code:**
```python
print("---------------Welcome To The Mr. MOMO Restaurant----------------")
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`print()` Function:** This function is used to display the welcome message on the screen. It outputs the string `"---------------Welcome To The Mr. MOMO Restaurant----------------"` to the console when the program starts.

---

## **2. Defining the Menu**

### **Purpose:**
- Store all menu categories, items, and their prices in a structured format using a dictionary.

### **Code:**
```python
menu = {
    "Pizza": {"Paneer Pizza": 100, "Chicken Pizza": 150},
    "Coffee": {"Cold Coffee": 140, "Hot Coffee": 120},
    "Chai": {"Masala Chai": 25, "Tandoori Chai": 30, "Normal Chai": 10},
    "Burger": {"Veg Burger": 70, "Chicken Burger": 80},
    "Momo": {"Paneer Momo": 80, "Chicken Momo": 90, "Steam Momo": 70},
    "Pastry": {"Chocolate Pastry": 70, "Vanilla Pastry": 65},
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`menu` Dictionary:** 
  - The `menu` variable is a dictionary containing categories of food as keys (e.g., `"Pizza"`, `"Coffee"`).
  - Each category is itself a dictionary with items as keys (e.g., `"Paneer Pizza"`) and their prices as values (e.g., `100`).
  - **Nested Dictionary:** This structure allows easy access to items and their prices based on the category selected by the user.

---

## **3. Displaying the Available Categories**

### **Purpose:**
- Show the user the available categories from which they can choose items to order.

### **Code:**
```python
print(" Please select a category from the following: ")
for category in menu.keys():
    print(f" - {category}")
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`menu.keys()` Method:**
  - **`menu.keys()`** returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys (categories) in the `menu` dictionary.
  - The keys in this case are `"Pizza"`, `"Coffee"`, `"Chai"`, etc.
- **`for` Loop:**
  - The `for` loop iterates over each category returned by `menu.keys()`.
  - Each category is printed to the console, preceded by a dash (`-`) for better readability.

## **4. Initializing the Total Order Cost**

### **Purpose:**
- Start with a total cost of zero, which will be incremented as the user adds items to their order.

### **Code:**
```python
order_total = 0
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`order_total` Variable:**
  - This variable is initialized to `0` and will hold the cumulative cost of all items the user orders.
  - Each time the user orders an item, its price will be added to `order_total`.

---

## **5. User Interaction Loop**

### **Purpose:**
- Allow the user to continue selecting items until they decide to stop ordering.

### **Code:**
```python
while True:
    selected_category = input(" Enter the category you want to order from ---> ")

    if selected_category in menu:
        print(f" You selected {selected_category}. Here are the items available:")
        for item, price in menu[selected_category].items():
            print(f" {item} : {price}")

        item_1 = input(" Enter the item you want to order ---> ")

        if item_1 in menu[selected_category]:
            order_total += menu[selected_category][item_1]
            print(f" Your item '{item_1}' has been added to your order!")
        else:
            print(f" Ordered item '{item_1}' is not available in {selected_category}!")
    else:
        print(f" Selected category '{selected_category}' is not available!")
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`while True:` Loop:**
  - The `while True:` loop creates an infinite loop, which keeps the ordering process active until the user decides to stop.
- **Category Selection:**
  - **`selected_category = input("...")`:** This prompts the user to enter a category they want to order from.
  - **`if selected_category in menu:`** checks if the selected category exists in the `menu` dictionary.
    - If the category exists, the program proceeds to show the available items in that category.
    - **`for item, price in menu[selected_category].items():`** iterates through the items and their prices in the selected category, printing them to the console.
  - If the selected category does not exist, the program informs the user that the category is not available.
- **Item Selection:**
  - **`item_1 = input("...")`:** Prompts the user to enter the specific item they want to order from the chosen category.
  - **`if item_1 in menu[selected_category]:`** checks if the entered item exists within the selected category.
    - If the item exists, its price is added to `order_total` using `order_total += menu[selected_category][item_1]`.
    - If the item does not exist, the program informs the user that the item is not available in the selected category.

---

## **6. Asking for Additional Orders**

### **Purpose:**
- Determine if the user wants to continue ordering or finish their order.

### **Code:**
```python
another_order = input(" Do you want to order from another category? (Yes/No) ---> ")

if another_order.lower() != "yes":
    break
```

### **Explanation:**
- **`another_order = input("...")`:**
  - This asks the user if they want to order from another category.
  - **`.lower()` Method:** Converts the userâ€™s input to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.
  - If the user enters anything other than "yes," the `if` condition is satisfied, and `break` is executed to exit the loop, ending the ordering process.

---

## **7. Displaying the Total Bill**

### **Purpose:**
- Show the user the total cost of all items they have ordered.

### **Code:**
```python
print(f" Your total bill is ---> {order_total}")
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Final Bill Display:**
  - The program prints the total amount stored in `order_total` to the console.
  - This is the sum of all the items the user has ordered during the session.

---

## **8. Running the Program**

### **Purpose:**
- Start the program by calling the `restaurant()` function.

### **Code:**
```python
restaurant()
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Function Call:**
  - The `restaurant()` function is called, initiating the entire restaurant ordering process.
  - This line is crucial because it triggers the sequence of operations defined within the `restaurant()` function, making the program interactive.

---

# **Summary**

This code provides a structured way for users to order food items from a restaurant menu by selecting categories and items interactively. It uses loops, conditionals, and dictionary operations to handle user input, validate selections, and calculate the total bill. The code is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear feedback and allowing the user to continue or finish their order based on their choices.

This breakdown should help you understand each part of the code and its function within the overall program. Save this explanation along with your code for future reference.
